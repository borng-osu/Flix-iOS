### Notes
This week was pretty easy! I didn't have time to get around to the Bonus User Stories, but I will make sure I implement them later.

That said, getting these gifs to work with the README is honestly a headache. Everytime I make a recording, either hackmd or Github will just not accept it for whatever reason. No matter how short I try to keep it or how small I make the image size.

### Notes
Understanding table view was very rewarding and easy to do. Similarly, setting up the table cell was rather smooth and interesting! I enjoy XCode for how intertwined the graphic elements and the code are and how immediate it is to see those interactions. The only difficulties I experienced were in getting the Bonus User Story involving constraints to work properly, though this only took a few minutes to overcome.
