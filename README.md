### Notes
Understanding table view was very rewarding and easy to do. Similarly, setting up the table cell was rather smooth and interesting! I enjoy XCode for how intertwined the graphic elements and the code are and how immediate it is to see those interactions. The only difficulties I experienced were in getting the Bonus User Story involving constraints to work properly, though this only took a few minutes to overcome.
